    "description": "In the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), a logistics company must distribute goods from a single depot to \\param{N} customers using \\param{V} vehicles. Each vehicle has a limited capacity: Vehicle \\param{v} has a capacity of \\param{Capacity}_v units. Each customer has an associated demand that must be met within their specific time windows.\n\nThe demands for the \\param{N} customers are as follows:\nCustomer \\param{c} requires \\param{Demand}_c units of goods and must be served between \\param{StartTime}_c and \\param{EndTime}_c.\n\nThe locations (latitude and longitude) of the customers are as follows:\nCustomer \\param{c}: Latitude \\param{Latitude}_c, Longitude \\param{Longitude}_c.\n\nEach customer also has a specific service time:\nCustomer \\param{c} requires \\param{ServiceTime}_c minutes for service.\n\nThe goal is to determine the optimal routing of the vehicles such that all customer demands are met within their respective time windows, the total distance traveled is minimized, and the capacity constraints of each vehicle are not exceeded.",
