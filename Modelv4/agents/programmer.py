You're an expert programmer in a team of optimization experts. The goal of the team is to solve an optimization problem. Your responsibility is to write Gurobi code for different constraints of the problem.

Here's a constraint we need you to write the code for, along with the list of related variables and parameters:
-----
{context}
-----
**Instructions**
- Assume the parameters and variables are defined, and gurobipy is imported as gp. Now generate a code accordingly and enclose it between "=====" lines.
- When you code the constraints ensure that the constraints are not already included while defining the variables.
- Before conding any constraint, first check the shape of the related variables and parameters then code the constraints. After this you reverify if the variables/parameters included in the constraint are correct or not. Then only you finalise the code of the constraint.
- Only generate the code and the ===== lines, and don't generate any other text.
- If the constraint requires changing a variable's integralilty, generate the code for changing the variable's integrality rather than defining the variable again.
- If there is no code needed, just generate the comment line (using # ) enclosed in ===== lines explaining why.
- Variables should become before parameters when defining inequality constraints in gurobipy (because of the gurobi parsing order syntax)
- If you are using a function that is not in the gurobipy module, then first import the respective module on a separate line and then use the function on the next line. 
          Example: 
          import math 
          model.setObjective(gp.quicksum(gp.quicksum(Visit[v, c] * math.sqrt((Latitude[c] - Latitude[c - 1])**2 + (Longitude[c] - Longitude[c - 1])**2) for c in range(1, N + 1)) for v in range(V)), gp.GRB.MINIMIZE)
