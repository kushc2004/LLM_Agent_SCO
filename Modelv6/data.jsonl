{"role": "user", "content": "description: Given a 3-D tic-tac-toe board, where players take turns placing $X$'s and $O$'s, the game typically ends when one player completes a line or diagonal; that is, when they manage to place their symbols in three cells that form a line or diagonal in the grid. The twist that is tackled here is that the game continues until every cell contains a symbol, and the goal is to arrange the symbols to minimize the number of completed lines or diagonals."},
