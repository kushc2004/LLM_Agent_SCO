In the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), a logistics company must distribute goods from a single depot to six customers using three vehicles. Each vehicle has a limited capacity: Vehicle 1 has a capacity of 50 units, Vehicle 2 has a capacity of 60 units, and Vehicle 3 has a capacity of 55 units. Each customer has an associated demand that must be met within their specific time windows.

The demands for the six customers are as follows:
Customer 1 requires 10 units of goods and must be served between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM.
Customer 2 requires 15 units of goods and must be served between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM.
Customer 3 requires 20 units of goods and must be served between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM.
Customer 4 requires 25 units of goods and must be served between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM.
Customer 5 requires 30 units of goods and must be served between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM.
Customer 6 requires 35 units of goods and must be served between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM.

The locations (latitude and longitude) of the customers are as follows:
Customer 1: Latitude 40.712776, Longitude -74.005974
Customer 2: Latitude 40.730610, Longitude -73.935242
Customer 3: Latitude 40.749825, Longitude -73.987963
Customer 4: Latitude 40.758896, Longitude -73.985130
Customer 5: Latitude 40.748817, Longitude -73.985428
Customer 6: Latitude 40.741895, Longitude -73.989308

Each customer also has a specific service time:
Customer 1 requires 15 minutes for service.
Customer 2 requires 20 minutes for service.
Customer 3 requires 25 minutes for service.
Customer 4 requires 30 minutes for service.
Customer 5 requires 35 minutes for service.
Customer 6 requires 40 minutes for service.

The goal is to determine the optimal routing of the vehicles such that all customer demands are met within their respective time windows, the total distance traveled is minimized, and the capacity constraints of each vehicle are not exceeded.
