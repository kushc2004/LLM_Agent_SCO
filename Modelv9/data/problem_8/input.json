{"problem_type": "MILP", "description": "A government agency is responsible for ensuring the efficient distribution of essential crops (wheat, paddy, and sugarcane) from farmers (production locations) to retailers (consumption locations) in the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, India. The agency plans to establish a network of warehouses to consolidate and manage the flow of these crops. Your task is to determine:\\n\\n1. **Optimal Number of Warehouses and their Locations**: Where should the agency build warehouses to minimize total supply chain costs, while considering potential disruptions?\\n2. **Resource Allocation**: How should the agency allocate crop transportation and storage resources under normal and disrupted scenarios to meet retailer demand?\\n\\n**Key Considerations**:\\n\\n- **Three-Echelon Supply Chain**: Farmers to Warehouses to Retailers\\n- **Disruption Scenarios**:\\n    - **Production Disruption**: All farmers cannot supply crops due to unforeseen events (e.g., natural disasters, disease outbreaks). In this case the production quantity at all locations will be reduced while the demand will remain the same. The other production locations that have surplus produce will supply the crops and also other warehouses will supply crops to the warehouse if required. Here the other warehouses will also directly supply the the retailers (surplus warehouse to retailer). Here the crops quantity shipped from each production location to warehouse will be different as in the normal scenario but the quantity supplied from each warehouse to the retailer might be same.\\n    - **Warehouse Disruption**: A percentage of warehouse capacity becomes unavailable (e.g., due to flooding, or power outages). If a warehouse is disrupted, the capacity of the warehouse will be reduced. We will use a reassignment strategy where along with the existing warehouse other surplus warehouse will also supply to the retailers (from disrupted warehouse to retailer + from another warehouse to retailer). Along with this other surplus warehouse will also supply crops to the disrupted warehouse (from warehouse to warehouse). Above both strategies will be used to meet the demand in case of warehouse disruption scenario. Here the crops quantity shipped from each production location to warehouse will be same as in the normal scenario but the quantity supplied from each warehouse to the retailer might get different.\\n- You should consider variables for supply of crops in different strategies in both the disruption scenarios.\\n- **Limited Warehouse Capacity**: Each warehouse has a maximum storage capacity. This value is \\\\param{MaxWarehouseCapacity} and same for every warehouse.\\n- **Transportation Costs**: Transportation costs are directly proportional to distance and vary by crop. This cost is only the \\\\param{TransportationCost}{c} * distance * some binary variable. Do not include quantity in the transportation cost.\\n- **Holding Costs**: Each crop has a specific \\\\param{HoldingCost}{c} at the warehouse.\\n- **Lost Sales Penalty**: A \\\\param{LostSalesPenalty}{c} is incurred for unmet demand at the retailers.\\n- **Proximity to Transportation Hubs**: Warehouses should be strategically located within a \\\\param{MaxDistanceWarehouseRailway} of major railway stations to facilitate inter-state transportation.\\n- Consider the inventory costs as well that is the total holding cost required in each scenario. You should add constraints to find the inventory quantity in each scenario. It is the inventory quantity multiplied by the \\\\param{HoldingCost}{c} of each crop.\\n\\nYour goal is to determine the optimal values for the decision variables, minimizing the total supply chain cost while considering potential disruptions and satisfying all constraints.\\n\\nThe data we have is the:\\n\\n- All production locations are actually the locations of the villages.\\n- List of \\\\param{ProductionLocations} with \\\\param{ProductionQuantity}{ic} of each crop at each location\\n- List of \\\\param{RetailerLocations} with \\\\param{DemandQuantity}{jc} of each crop at each locations\\n- All production locations are potential warehouse locations that is a warehouse can be placed at any village location.\\n- List of \\\\param{Crops} produced\\n- List of nearby \\\\param{RailwayStations} locations\\n- Set of \\\\param{ProductionDisruptionScenarios}\\n- Set of \\\\param{WarehouseDisruptionScenarios}\\n- \\\\param{MaxDistanceWarehouseRailway}\\n- \\\\param{TransportationCost}{c}\\n- \\\\param{DisruptedTransportationCost}{c}\\n- \\\\param{MaxWarehouseCapacity}\\n- \\\\param{HoldingCost}{c}\\n- \\\\param{FixedCostWarehouse}. This value is constant and same for every warehouse.\\n- \\\\param{LostSalesPenalty}{c}\\n- \\\\param{ProbabilityProductionDisruption}{s}\\n- \\\\param{ProbabilityWarehouseDisruption}{w}\\n- \\\\param{PercentageCapacityAffected}{w}\\n- Distance matrix:\\n    - \\\\param{DistanceProductionWarehouse}{ih} (this distances is same as the distance between every two potential warehouse locations also)\\n    - \\\\param{DistanceWarehouseRetailer}{hj}\\n    - \\\\param{DistanceWarehouseRailway}{hr}\\n    \\n\\nYour task is to formulate the mathematical model with the objective function to minimize the total supply chain cost, incorporating the \\\\param{TransportationCost}{c}, \\\\param{HoldingCost}{c}, \\\\param{FixedCostWarehouse}, and \\\\param{LostSalesPenalty}{c} (\\\\param{LostSalesPenalty}{c} multiplied by quantity of lost sales).
