    "description": "A protein powder supply chain consists of Contract Manufacturer, Warehouse and Distributor. The flow is Contract Manufacturer to Warehouse to Distributor. Warehouses are at 3 different locations. The Distributors are located at 10 different locations. The Manufactures who have applied to be selected as Contract Manufacturers are total 3 in number. Only 2 manufactures would be selected from these. The supply chain also has supplier which are 5 in number.Goods goes from one supplier to one bonded warehouse only and the bonded warehouses are 2 in number.Goods can either go from bonded warehouse to manufacturer or from bonded warehouse to warehouse only.The goods can go from only one bonded warehouse to only one warehouse if it choose to go that route.Also one distributor can take goods from only one warehouse only.Optimise the supply chain network and select the two best manufacturers that would minimise the transportation cost. It should also tell which manufacturer is supplying to which warehouse and which warehouse is supplying to which distributor. The cost of transportation per km is Rs. \\param{TransportationCostPerKM}.\\nAlso we are including carbon emission in total cost such that the amount of distance travelled from one facility to another which is multilped by emission cost per km which is \\param{CarbonEmissionCostPerKM} which is then multiplied by carbon tax equal to \\param{CarbonTax}.Also fixed carbon emission cost which is equal to \\param{FixedCarbonEmissionCost} multiplied by carbon tax equal to \\param{CarbonTax}.Sum of all the carbon emission the fixed carbon taxes should be less than the carbon credits which the user will input.\\nThe distances are specified below.\\ndistance  matrix tells the distance between supplier and bonded warehouse\\ndistance1 matrix tells the distance between manufacturer and warehouse\\ndistance2 matrix tells the distance between warehouse and distributor\\ndistance3 matrix tells the distance between bonded warehouse and warehouse\\ndistance4 matrix tells the distance between bonded warehouse and manufacturer",

The supply chain involves selecting two contract manufacturers out of three, determining the flow of goods from five suppliers through two bonded warehouses to the manufacturers and then to three warehouses, and finally distributing to ten different distributor locations. The objective is to find the optimal supply chain network that minimizes the total cost, including transportation costs and carbon emissions, while staying within a specified carbon credit limit.",
