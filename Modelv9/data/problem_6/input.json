    "description": "A protein powder supply chain consists of \\param{Suppliers}, \\param{BondedWarehouses}, \\param{Manufacturers}, \\param{Warehouses}, and \\param{Distributors}. The flow of goods is from \\param{Suppliers} to \\param{BondedWarehouses}, from \\param{BondedWarehouses} goods can either go to \\param{Manufacturers} or to \\param{Warehouses}, then the goods from the \\param{Manufacturers} move to \\param{Warehouses} to then to \\param{Distributors}. \\param{Warehouses} are at \\param{NumWarehousesLocations} different locations. The \\param{Distributors} are located at \\param{NumDistributorLocations} different locations. The \\param{Manufacturers} is \\param{NumManufacturers} in number. The supply chain also has \\param{Suppliers} which are \\param{NumSuppliers} in number located at different locations. In the supply chain we have \\param{NumBondedWarehouses} \\param{BondedWarehouses} from where the goods goes from one \\param{Supplier} to one \\param{BondedWarehouse} only. Goods originating from a \\param{BondedWarehouse} have the option to be transferred directly to a single \\param{Warehouse}. Each \\param{Distributor} sources goods from exclusively one \\param{Warehouse}, while \\param{Warehouses} can supply multiple \\param{Distributors}. This task involves optimizing a supply chain network with a transportation cost of \\param{TransportationCost} per kilometer. The optimization model should use binary flow variables (0 or 1) to indicate whether goods are transported between facilities, where 1 represents flow and 0 represents no flow. The quantity of goods transported is represented by continuous variables, allowing for a range of values.\\n\\nThe distances are specified below.\\n\\param{Distance} matrix tell the distance between \\param{Supplier} and \\param{BondedWarehouse}\\n\\param{Distance1} matrix tell the distance between \\param{Manufacturer} and \\param{Warehouse}\\n\\param{Distance2} matrix tell the distance between \\param{Warehouse} and \\param{Distributor}\\n\\param{Distance3} matrix tell the distance between \\param{BondedWarehouse} and \\param{Warehouse}\\n\\param{Distance4} matrix tell the distance between \\param{BondedWarehouse} and \\param{Manufacturer}\\n\\n\\param{Manufacturers} can distribute products to any number of \\param{Warehouses}, and those \\param{Warehouses}, in turn, can supply any number of \\param{Distributors}. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, which is calculated by multiplying the quantity shipped across each link in the network (\\param{Manufacturer}-to-\\param{Warehouse} and \\param{Warehouse}-to-\\param{Distributor}) by a fixed cost per unit of \\param{UnitCost}. The goal is to determine the optimal flow of goods through the network that minimizes the total cost while meeting the demand of the \\param{Distributors}.",
