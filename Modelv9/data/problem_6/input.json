    "description": "The supply chain is structured as a multi-echelon network, starting with three geographically dispersed Suppliers. Each Supplier is exclusively linked to one of two Bonded Warehouses, acting as intermediate points for imported or specialized goods. This means that a Supplier's protein powder will always first pass through its designated Bonded Warehouse.\nFrom the Bonded Warehouses, the protein powder can take one of two routes.  It can either proceed directly to one of two Warehouses for storage and distribution, or it can be sent to the sole Manufacturer for further processing or packaging. This introduces a key decision point in the supply chain: whether to distribute the raw protein powder directly or after value is added through manufacturing. \nRegardless of the chosen route, all protein powder ultimately converges at the two strategically located Warehouses. These Warehouses serve as the primary distribution hubs, responsible for fulfilling the demands of four Distributors spread across different locations. Each Distributor has an exclusive sourcing agreement with only one Warehouse, simplifying the final leg of the supply chain. \nThe optimization challenge lies in determining the optimal flow of protein powder through this network to minimize the overall transportation cost along with total quantity cost. With a transportation cost of Rs. \\param{TransportationCost} per kilometer, every kilometer traveled directly impacts the profitability of the supply chain.Also the demand of the distributor should also be asked the user all distrubutior would have the same demand but it should be asked from the user to allocate it dynamically \nThe distances are specified below.\ndistance  matrix tell the distance between Supplier and Bonded Warehouse\ndistance1 matrix tell the distance between Manufacturer and Warehouse\ndistance2 matrix tell the distance between Warehouse and Distributor\ndistance3 matrix tell the distance between Bonded Warehouse and Warehouse\ndistance4 matrix tell the distance between Bonded Warehouse and Manufacturer\nIn a complex supply chain network, manufacturers often distribute their products to multiple warehouses strategically located to optimize distribution. These warehouses, acting as intermediary points, then supply the products to a network of distributors responsible for getting the goods to the end consumers.  The challenge lies in determining the most cost-effective way to move the products through this intricate web of manufacturers, warehouses, and distributors. The objective of optimizing this supply chain is to minimize the total transportation cost along with total quantity cost , which is calculated by considering the quantity of goods shipped across each individual link in the network – that is, from each manufacturer to each warehouse, and from each warehouse to each distributor.  For the sake of simplicity, we assume a quantity cost of \\param{QuantityCost} per unit shipped across any link in the network. The ultimate goal is to find the optimal flow of goods – meaning the ideal quantity to ship across each link – that successfully meets the specific demand of each distributor while simultaneously ensuring the lowest possible overall transportation cost along with total quantity cost .",
