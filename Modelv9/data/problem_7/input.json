    "description": "A government agency in Sitapur district, Uttar Pradesh, India, aims to optimize the distribution of \\param{Crops} (wheat, paddy, and sugarcane) from \\param{ProductionLocations} (villages) to \\param{RetailerLocations} through a network of warehouses. The goal is to determine the optimal number and locations of warehouses to minimize the total supply chain cost, considering potential disruptions. The supply chain has three echelons: Farmers to Warehouses to Retailers. Two disruption scenarios are considered: Production Disruption, where a percentage of farmers in a specific location cannot supply crops, and Warehouse Disruption, where a percentage of warehouse capacity becomes unavailable. The model considers limited warehouse capacity, transportation costs (varying by crop and distance), holding costs (per crop, per unit), lost sales penalties (per crop, per unit), and proximity to \\param{RailwayStationLocations} for inter-state transportation. The model also considers inventory costs, calculated as the total holding cost required in each scenario. The objective is to minimize the total supply chain cost, including transportation, holding, fixed warehouse costs, and lost sales penalties.",
    "problem_info": "This is a supply chain optimization problem that involves determining the optimal number and locations of warehouses, as well as the allocation of resources under normal and disrupted scenarios, in order to minimize the total supply chain cost while satisfying supply, demand, and capacity constraints.",
    "input_format": "The input data consists of the following: the number of production locations, the number of potential warehouse locations (same as production locations), the number of retailer locations, the number of crops, the number of railway station locations, a set of production location disruption scenarios, a set of warehouse location disruption scenarios, the maximum distance between a warehouse and a railway station, the cost of transportation per km per kg, the cost of transportation after disruption per km per kg, the maximum capacity of each warehouse, the cost of holding each crop per kg, the fixed cost of opening & operating a warehouse, the cost of lost sales of each crop per kg, the probability of each production location disruption scenario occurring, the probability of each warehouse location disruption scenario occurring, the percentage of warehouse capacity affected by each warehouse location disruption scenario, and the distances between each pair of production locations, potential warehouse locations, retailer locations, and railway station locations.",
    "output_info": "The output should provide the optimal number of warehouses, their locations, the quantity of each crop transported from each production location to each warehouse, the quantity of each crop transported from each warehouse to each retailer, and the total supply chain cost, all while considering both normal and disrupted scenarios.",
    "output_format": "The output should include the optimal number of warehouses, a list of the selected warehouse locations, the flow of crops from production locations to warehouses, the flow of crops from warehouses to retailers, and the total cost.",
