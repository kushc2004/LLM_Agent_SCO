Formulating objective ...
==========
The objective is to maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods. This means we need to calculate the revenue generated by each good and sum them up.  

We can define a new variable:

* **TotalRevenue**: The total revenue generated from producing all goods.

Now, we can formulate the objective function as follows:

```json
{
    "objective": {
        "description": "Maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods.",
        "formulation": "\\max \quad \\textup{TotalRevenue}"
    },
    "auxiliary_constraints": [
        {
            "description": "Total revenue is the sum of revenue from each good",
            "formulation": "\\textup{TotalRevenue} = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\textup{N}} \\textup{ProductionQuantity}_{j} \\cdot \\textup{Revenue}_{j}"
        }
    ],
    "new_variables": [
        {
            "definition": "Total revenue generated from producing all goods",
            "symbol": "TotalRevenue",
            "shape": []
        }
    ]
}
```

You are an expert mathematical formulator and an optimization professor at a top university. Your task is to model objective of the problem in the standard LP or MILP form. 

Here is a objective we need you to model:
-----
Maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods
-----

Here is some context on the problem:
-----
A firm has a limited supply of raw materials and aims to maximize its revenue by deciding the production quantities of various goods. Each good requires specific quantities of raw materials, and each good yields a specific revenue per unit.
-----

Here is the list of available variables:
-----
[
    {
        "definition": "Quantity of good j to produce",
        "symbol": "{ProductionQuantity}_j",
        "shape": [
            "N"
        ]
    }
]
-----

And finally, here is list of input parameters:
-----
[
    {
        "definition": "Number of goods",
        "symbol": "{N}",
        "shape": []
    },
    {
        "definition": "Number of raw materials",
        "symbol": "{M}",
        "shape": []
    },
    {
        "definition": "Available amount of raw material i",
        "symbol": "{AvailableAmount}_i",
        "shape": [
            "M"
        ]
    },
    {
        "definition": "Amount of raw material i required per unit of good j",
        "symbol": "{Requirement}_ij",
        "shape": [
            "M",
            "N"
        ]
    },
    {
        "definition": "Revenue per unit of good j",
        "symbol": "{Revenue}_j",
        "shape": [
            "N"
        ]
    }
]
-----

First, take a deep breath and explain how we should define the objective. Feel free to define new variables if you think it is necessary. Then, generate a json file accordingly with the following format (STICK TO THIS FORMAT!):


{
    "objective": {
      "description": "The description of the objective",
      "formulation": "The LaTeX mathematical expression representing the formulation of the objective"
    },
    "auxiliary_constraints": [
        {
            "description": "The description of the auxiliary constraint",
            "formulation": "The LaTeX mathematical expression representing the formulation of the auxiliary constraint"
        }
    ]
    "new_variables": [
        {
            "definition": "The definition of the variable",
            "symbol": "The symbol for the variable",
            "shape": [ "symbol1", "symbol2", ... ]
        }
    ],
    
}

- Your formulation should be in LaTeX mathematical format (do not include the $ symbols). 
- Note that I'm going to use python json.loads() function to parse the json file, so please make sure the format is correct (don't add ',' before enclosing '}' or ']' characters.
- Generate the complete json file and don't omit anything.
- Use '```json' and '```' to enclose the json file.
- Important: You can not define new parameters. You can only define new variables.Use CamelCase and full words for new variable symbols, and do not include indices in the symbol (e.g. ItemsSold instead of itemsSold or items_sold or ItemsSold_i)
- Use \textup{} when writing variable and parameter names. For example (\sum_{i=1}^{N} \textup{ItemsSold}_{i} instead of \sum_{i=1}^{N} ItemsSold_{i})
- Use \quad for spaces.
- Use empty list ([]) if no new variables are defined.
- Always use non-strict inequalities (e.g. \leq instead of <), even if the constraint is strict.
- Define auxiliary constraints when necessary. Set it to an empty list ([]) if no auxiliary constraints are needed. If new auxiliary constraints need new variables, add them to the "new_variables" list too.

Take a deep breath and solve the problem step by step.

The objective is to maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods. We can achieve this by multiplying the revenue per unit of each good with the corresponding production quantity and summing over all goods.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Objective Function:**
    * We need to maximize the total revenue, which is calculated as the sum of the revenue generated by each good.
    * The revenue generated by each good is calculated by multiplying the revenue per unit of that good with the quantity produced.
    * Therefore, the objective function is:
        * \(\max \sum_{j=1}^{N} \textup{Revenue}_j \cdot \textup{ProductionQuantity}_j \)

* **Auxiliary Constraints:** None are needed for this objective function.

Here's the JSON output:
```json
{
    "objective": {
        "description": "Maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods.",
        "formulation": "\\max \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\textup{Revenue}_j \\cdot \\textup{ProductionQuantity}_j"
    },
    "auxiliary_constraints": [],
    "new_variables": []
}
```

Formulating objective ...
==========
Okay, let's formulate the objective function.

**Explanation**

The goal is to maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods. We know the revenue per unit of each good (\textup{Revenue}_j) and the quantity of each good produced (\textup{ProductionQuantity}_j).  Therefore, the objective function is simply the sum of the revenue generated by each good.

**Objective Function Formulation**

```json
{
    "objective": {
        "description": "Maximize the total revenue generated from producing all goods",
        "formulation": "\\max \quad \\sum_{j=1}^{\\textup{N}} \\textup{Revenue}_j \\cdot \\textup{ProductionQuantity}_j"
    },
    "auxiliary_constraints": [],
    "new_variables": []
}
```

Formulation: \max \quad \sum_{j=1}^{\textup{N}} \textup{Revenue}_j \cdot \textup{ProductionQuantity}_j
