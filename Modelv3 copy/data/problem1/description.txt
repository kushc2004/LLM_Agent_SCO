A firm produces n different goods using m different raw materials. Let bi, i = 1, ..., m be the available amount of the i-th raw material. The j-th good, j=1, ..., n requires ai,j units of the i-th material and results in a revenue of cj per unit produced. The firm faces the problem of deciding how much of each good to produce in order to maximize its total revenue.Formulate the problem as an LP and write a Gurobi code to solve it.
